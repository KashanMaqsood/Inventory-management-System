# Inventory-management-System
I have made the solo project on Inventory management System that alows the user to add, display, update ,search, delete, save to file and load from file the invenatry like guns, rifles and pistols. It will help the user to monitor the inventary and their quantity and price. The code includes the basic concepts of c++ language.
C++ Concepts Included:

1. Structs: The code uses a struct to represent a product, which is a collection of variables of different data types.

2. Arrays: The code uses an array to store multiple products.

3. Functions: The code uses functions to perform specific tasks, such as adding, displaying, updating, deleting, searching, saving, and loading products.

4. File Input/Output: The code uses file streams to read and write data to a file.

5. String Manipulation: The code uses string manipulation functions to parse data from a file.

6. Loops: The code uses loops to iterate over the product array.

7. Conditional Statements: The code uses if-else statements to make decisions based on conditions.

Advantages:

1. Easy to Use: The code provides a simple and intuitive menu-driven interface for users to interact with.

2. Data Persistence: The code allows data to be saved to a file, ensuring that it is not lost when the program terminates.

3. Flexibility: The code allows for easy addition of new products, updating of existing products, and deletion of products.

4. Search Capability: The code provides a search function to quickly find products by name.

5. Scalability: The code can handle a large number of products, making it suitable for businesses with extensive inventories.

6. Platform Independence: The code is written in C++ and can be compiled on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

7. Reusability: The code can be easily modified and extended to accommodate additional features or requirements.

Overall, the code demonstrates a solid understanding of C++ concepts and provides a practical solution for managing inventory.
